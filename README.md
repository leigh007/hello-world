# hello-world
Practice GitHub excercise and possibly a place to store random ideas, if I need to. 

## Hello! I am Leigh-Anna :unicorn: ...

...and I'm located in the Southern side of the Midwest, in the USA. Nice and vague, huh? Well, I'm a bit of a precautionary person, due to a history of having a stalker install a keylogger and monitoring software, on multiple devices. It was a crazy ex, so don't get any ideas and think I'm really that interesting, to where I attract stalkers. I'm not! 

### About Me...

I'm kind of weird but wouldn't have it any other way! :laughing: I love hip-hop, like [Atmosphere](https://rhymesayers.com/artists/atmosphere), [Lowkey](https://youtu.be/nN4eySlToGw) and most definitely [Brother Ali](https://youtu.be/04bp4bG6Zhk), as quoted below: :heart: 
> Use your heart, for what hearts are for 


I am pretty good at problem solving because I think outside of the box. I'm extremely detail oriented and am able to find creative solutions, to problems I've encountered. 

My life goals revolve around helping women/children survivors of DV & abuse. I am a survivor and I know the havoc this can wreak on people's lives. I plan to start a non-profit and sincerely hope to be able to make the world a better place than it was when I got here. 

### Experience...

I've been studying HTML, CSS & JS for about 2 years. Recently I've been playing around with MySQL, because I am an avid collector of information!! So, how better to organize this than my database! I have also learned some Python, Swift and use the terminal pretty regularly. 
I like formatting in `markdown` and love reading about design and UI/UX. 

I am also very interested in learning my way around cyber security and protecting my annonymity. **Cybrary** is a great place to learn that stuff!! 


### Help Me w/ Command Line configuration! :laughing:

If anyone might have any simple explanations regarding `[error]` msgs in the terminal, please share. Specifically, these errors are related to:
- Node
- Homebrew
- NPM

I think I initially installed NPM from the webpage and then Homebrew from withing the terminal. Can't remember where I installed Node from... but I think I somehow installed these into the wrong locations, redering the errors based on missing dependencies. 

I understand the basics of this but have no idea how to remedy it. I tried uninstalling Node from the command line, because **`brew doc`** suggesting doing this, based on the folder permissions and missing dependencies. I've tried to remedy the folder permissions but evidently I am missing something. 

Anyway, I know noone will probably see this unless I point them to it but whatever... I write a lot and I'm okay with that. :smile:
